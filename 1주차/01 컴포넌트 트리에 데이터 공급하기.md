# Context in React

Context is a feature in React that provides a way to share data between components in the same context across the entire component tree.

## Why use Context?

Context is used to solve the **Props Drilling** issue that arises when passing values between components in a deep component hierarchy. Instead of passing props at each level, Context allows you to share data across the component tree without explicitly passing props at every level.

By using Context, you can supply data globally across the component tree, effectively resolving the Props Drilling problem.

## Context API

The Context API is the set of React features used to create and manage Context. Some key functions include `createContext` and `Context.Provider`.

### Creating a Context

You can create a new Context using `React.createContext`.

```javascript
import React from "react";
const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);
```
